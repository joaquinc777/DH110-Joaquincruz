# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation- Joaquin Cruz, DH110 
##Tentative Title: FamilyPlan

### About the project

As an older sibling from my mother's side, I have found it challenging to spend quality time together since my parents spend most of their time working. As I have started college, there have been conflicts at home since I am a commuter, and finding time to do chores and homework and connect with my family is complicated. Using a schedule to manage not only my school time but also my family time is crucial.

I have also found that my family is always busy, and the days they are free are unknown because there is no planning ahead of what we will do throughout the week and months to come. As I have gotten older, I have found it more difficult to manage school work and chores, and spending quality time with my family is an issue. I want to contribute to this UX project by creating an app so that people like my parents can plan their schedules accordingly and what they must do throughout the week, such as work, school, and chores. Set up dates to spend quality time together and connect as a family.

In this assignment, I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two mobile apps with goals similar to the ones of this project. The first,Cozi allows users to create a family planner. The second, 

The valuation will discuss each app's consistency to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and provide [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) with consideration for the target users, family members.
