# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation- Joaquin Cruz, DH110 
## Tentative Title: FamilyPlan

### About the project

As an older sibling from my mother's side, I have found it challenging to spend quality time together since my parents spend most of their time working. As I have started college, there have been conflicts at home since I am a commuter, and finding time to do chores and homework and connect with my family is complicated. Using a schedule to manage not only my school time but also my family time is crucial.

I have also found that my family is always busy, and the days they are free are unknown because there is no planning ahead of what we will do throughout the week and months to come. As I have gotten older, I have found it more difficult to manage school work and chores, and spending quality time with my family is an issue. I want to contribute to this UX project by creating an app so that people like my parents can plan their schedules accordingly and what they must do throughout the week, such as work, school, and chores. Set up dates to spend quality time together and connect as a family.

In this assignment, I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two mobile apps with goals similar to the ones of this project. The first, Cozi allows users to create a family planner, and allows family members to log in with their email and shared password and start working on scheduling. The second, Maple allows you to plan and organize tasks within your family, without the use of share password. It allows you to as well create new plans based on inspirations they have created for users.

The valuation will discuss each app's consistency to the [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and provide [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) with consideration for the target users, family members. 

## App 1: Cozi

#### Background Information
Cozi is an app created and available through all platforms. It allows users to coordinate and communicate everyone's schedules and activities, manage to-do lists, plan on dinner, and keep the whole family on the same page.
#### Heuristic Evaluation 
Overall: The creators are monetizing the app. The app is not as accessible as it should be. Users should be allowed to access features such as monthly planners, summer planners, various food recipes, and more. There are many issues, from organization to overload of information. If a user plans to use this app as long term it'll be more difficult due to the lack of freedom since you have to pay to have access to all features.
