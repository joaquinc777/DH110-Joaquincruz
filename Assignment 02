#Assignment 02: Usability Testing(UT) - Joaquin Cruz 


##Introduction to Cozy App


Cozi is a mobile app with a shared password. Family members can plan their activities and events together, hoping to help them settle different schedules and spend quality time together. One of the main reasons I wanted to perform User Testing for this mobile app is that it has the right idea of what type of mobile app I wish to create. However, its interface lacks many aspects, and it is not easy to navigate for Users.
