# Assignment 02: Usability Testing(UT) - Joaquin Cruz 


## Introduction to Cozy App

In today's world, it is rather tricky for family members to spend quality time with one another without the difficulty of running into time conflicts or busy schedules. Furthermore, Cozi is a mobile app with a shared password. Family members can plan their activities and events together, hoping to help them settle different schedules and spend quality time together. I wanted to perform User Testing for this mobile app because it has the right idea of what type of mobile app I wish to create. However, its interface needs more aspects, and it is not easy to navigate for Users.

## Rationale behind UT with list of Usability issues

While the app allows users to navigate different tabs, the pages can be misleading and include too much text. The app doesn't allow users to access multiple notifications, monthly calendars, etc. Furthermore, you must purchase a monthly subscription to eliminate ads, access numerous alarms, and have more features. Also, the app itself could be more straightforward in that whenever you click on a new tab, you don't know what to expect. For example, if you wish to add a personal recipe that the app recommends to your grocery list, it will confuse the user if they aren't navigated through how to complete this task. Furthermore, this app needs more freedom, not the best User Interface, and ambiguous buttons and features integrated into its system. 


## Purose of Usability testing

It is crucial to understand the user's frustrations and the root of this frustration when using an app that attempts to connect families. Yet, the app needs to meet the requirements in bringing the user back to its app, giving them freedom, and demonstrating that they wish to have more users. An app like Cozi should provide a well-designed and integrated interface that only needs users to remember what is included in different tabs. It also should not allow ads monetization and want users to upgrade to a pro version even if they had to make them pay for a better interface and flat fee. Many users have complained that it is lots of money per year/month and only a few other features are included but the ones discussed above. After all, if you wish to reunite family members and want more users to use your app, you should understand that this app has the right idea. However, it still needs to be worked on visually and logistically by making each button unique and not integrating too much text. 

## How I want to test?

Overall, I want users to complete different tasks they would normally do, but in the sense that all family members may view these tasks. I wish to test how the various tabs and buttons on the app can be complicated to navigate; if provided help, the user will feel satisfied because of the ambiguity. I want to test that the user understands that the interface also needs vast improvement to bring the user's attention. Furthermore, I wan to figure out what features could work and how I could use user feedback to develop further my hypothesis and solution to improve the app's interface and give users the freedom and effectiveness of using an app with these improvements.
