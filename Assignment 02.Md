# Assignment 02: Usability Testing(UT) - Joaquin Cruz 


## Introduction to Cozy App

In today's world, it is rather tricky for family members to spend quality time with one another without the difficulty of running into time conflicts or busy schedules. Furthermore, Cozi is a mobile app with a shared password. Family members can plan their activities and events together, hoping to help them settle different schedules and spend quality time together. I wanted to perform User Testing for this mobile app because it has the right idea of what type of mobile app I wish to create. However, its interface needs more aspects, and it is not easy to navigate for Users.

## Rationale behind UT with list of Usability issues

While the app allows users to navigate different tabs, the pages can be misleading and include too much text. The app doesn't allow users to access multiple notifications, monthly calendars, etc. Furthermore, you must purchase a monthly subscription to eliminate ads, access numerous alarms, and have more features. Also, the app itself could be more straightforward in that whenever you click on a new tab, you don't know what to expect. For example, if you wish to add a personal recipe that the app recommends to your grocery list, it will confuse the user if they aren't navigated through how to complete this task. Furthermore, this app needs more freedom, not the best User Interface, and ambiguous buttons and features integrated into its system.
